# Nightlife App
Website: https://nightlife-app-klm.herokuapp.com/

In this app you can search a place and see all the nightlife activities you can do.
You can see other people who are going to the bar and also add yourself to the going list of the bar for other people to see.

This is a project I made for FCC.

In this project I learned:
* How to make an Isomorphic App
* Redux and thunk
* Axios
* Mongo-connect to express-session
* Passport twitter

I got to practice:
* React
* API calls
* Passport
* Mongoose models
* Node js
* Express js

I'm giving credits to the following for some educational reference that helped me make this app:
